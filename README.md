  - Block explorer, e.g. [etherscan](https://etherscan.io)
- Development environment
  - VSCode and Solidity extensions
  - Remix
  - Hardhat and plugins
  - Other tools
- Solidity
  - Create a sample contract
  - Test the contract (locally)
  - Deploy contracts
  - Verify contracts on Etherscan
### Frontend (50%)
- Development environment
  - VSCode and extensions. [Scaffold-ETH](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth)
- Connect a wallet via Metamask
